   - unused: Here the process has not yet been allocated any memory or resources. It cannot be run until it is transitioned to another state.
   - embryo: Here the process has been allocated some memory and resources, but it has not yet been started. It is waiting to be transitioned to the RUNNABLE state.
   - sleeping: Here the processis not currently running, but it is still in memory. It may be waiting for an event to occur, such as an I/O operation to complete or a signal to be received.
   - runnable: Here the process is ready to be run. It is waiting for the CPU to be assigned to it.
   - running: A process in this stateHere the process is currently executing on the CPU. It has exclusive access to the CPU and can run its code.
   - zombie: Here the process has terminated, but its parent process has not yet reaped its exit status. The zombie process's memory is still allocated, but it cannot be run. Once its parent process reaches the exit status, the zombie                    process will be transitioned to the UNUSED state.

   - Inode: An inode is a data structure that stores information about a file or directory, such as its size, permissions, ownership, and data block pointers. Each file or directory has a unique inode number that identifies it within the file system.
   - Data Block: Data blocks are the actual storage units for file contents. They are typically 512 bytes in size and are located on disk. Inodes contain pointers to the data blocks associated with a file.
   - Buffer Cache: The buffer cache is a memory structure that caches disk blocks. When a process needs to read or write data from or to a file, the operating system first checks the buffer cache to see if the required data block is already in memory. If so, the data can be accessed directly from the buffer cache, avoiding the need to perform a slower disk I/O operation.
   - Name Lookup: Name lookup is the process of finding a file or directory by name. XV6 uses a simple directory structure with hard links to implement name lookup. Hard links are pointers from a directory entry to an inode, allowing multiple directory entries to refer to the same file.
   - Block Map: The block map keeps track of which data blocks are in use and which are free. When a new file is created or an existing file is enlarged, the operating system allocates new data blocks from the free block map. When a file is  deleted or shrunk, its data blocks are returned to the free block map.
   - Directory Operations: XV6 supports basic directory operations, such as creation, deletion, and listing. These operations involve updating directory entries and inode references to maintain the file system structure.
   - File I/O Operations: XV6 supports basic file I/O operations, such as reading and writing. These operations involve reading and writing data blocks from or to disk, using the buffer cache to optimize I/O performance.

   System calls are low-level functions provided by the kernel that allow user-space programs to request services from the kernel. These services  involve accessing hardware resources or performing  operations that cannot be done directly by user-space programs.
   - Executed in kernel mode
   - They require a context switch from user mode to kernel mode
   - They are slower than library functions due to context switching overhead
   - eg open(),read()
   - Library functions are higher-level functions that are typically written in user-space code and are linked into user-space programs. They provide a more convenient and abstract interface for performing common tasks, often by calling system calls internally.
   - Executed in user mode
   - Do not require a context switch
   - faster than system calls due to the absence of context switching overhead

Memory paging is a memory management technique that divides the physical memory of a computer into fixed-size pages and the logical address space of a process into fixed-size frames. When a process generates a virtual address, the memory management unit translates the virtual address into a physical address using a page table. If the required page is not in physical memory, a page fault occurs, and the operating system must load the page from disk into physical memory.
   - Eliminates the need for contiguous physical memory allocation: Paging allows processes to use non-contiguous physical memory, which improves memory utilization and allows multiple processes to share physical memory.
   - Protects processes from each other: Each process has its own page table, which prevents processes from accessing each other's memory. This isolation prevents memory corruption and security vulnerabilities.
   
   - Supports virtual memory: This flexibility increases multitasking and resource sharing.
   
   - Simplifies memory management: Paging simplifies memory management by dividing the address space into smaller, manageable units. This simplification makes it easier to allocate, deallocate, and manage memory.

   - ls: The ls command lists the contents of the current directory. It can also be used to list the contents of other directories if specified as arguments.
   - mkdir: The mkdir command creates a new directory. It takes the name of the directory to create as an argument.
   - rm: The rm command removes a file or directory. It takes the name of the file or directory to remove as an argument.

- Process synchronization is crucial in XV6 to prevent race conditions and ensure the consistent execution of concurrent processes when they access shared resources. Race conditions arise when multiple processes access and modify shared data simultaneously, potentially leading to data corruption or incorrect results.

XV6 employs various mechanisms to achieve process synchronization:

    - Spinlocks: Prevent simultaneous access to critical code sections using busy-waiting.
    - Condition Variables: Coordinate processes waiting for specific events alongside spinlocks.
    - Semaphores: Manage shared resource access with a count, allowing acquisition/release.
    - Barriers: Ensure all involved processes reach a designated point before continuing. Commonly used in parallel algorithms for stage synchronization.

  Interrupts in XV6 allow the operating system to respond to asynchronous events, switch between processes, handle I/O efficiently, and deal with errors. When an interrupt occurs, the processor jumps to an interrupt handler, which saves the processor's state, executes the necessary code, and restores the state before returning. Interrupts are essential for enabling responsive system operation.

      Virtual Memory in XV6: XV6 uses paging to manage virtual memory, dividing physical memory and a process's address space into fixed-size pages. The page table maps virtual to physical pages, translating addresses via the MMU. Page faults trigger disk loading for missing pages.

    -Advantages:
        - Efficient Memory Use: Enables shared physical memory among multiple processes.
        - Larger Address Space: Provides expanded address spaces for memory-intensive applications.
        - Protection & Isolation: Ensures process isolation, preventing memory corruption and enhancing security.
        - Demand Paging: Loads only required parts of a process's address space into physical memory, reducing memory usage.

   - Kernel Entry: Starts initial setup and configuration.
